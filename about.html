                        Empressors was found in 2000 by Mrs.Sangou who took the initiative
                        to start the business after the bankruptcy of LAOS Entreprise and 
                        now the company makes approximately 10 billion dollars per year.
                        It all started when Mrs.Sangou was experimenting with school owned
                        solar panels. She had huge interest in solar panels and everyday,
                        she would fidget with some equipments just to see how they are made.
                        Just after school, she launched a small company: IntsNet, which aims to 
                        help potential small business owners by preparing and filing the documents 
                        necessary to start a business in any state. For those already in business,
                        IntsNet can help with ongoing paperwork like filing annual reports, changing
                         a company name, and more. Though she liked the idea of the company, she wanted
                         to be involved in something related to what she loves.
